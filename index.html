        <p>Hello, Why should you never take sides in an argument at the dinner table? Trick question. It's the perfect time to take sides because no one's paying attention. Bring Tupperware.</p>
        <p>Dad: What is the difference between a piano, a tuna, and a pot of glue?</p>
<p>Me: I don't know.</p>
 <p>Dad: You can tuna piano but you can't piano a tuna.</p>
<p> Me: What about the pot of glue?</p>
<p> Dad: I knew you'd get stuck on that.</p>
