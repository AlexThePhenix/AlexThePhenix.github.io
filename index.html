        <p>Hello, Why should you never take sides in an argument at the dinner table? Trick question. It's the perfect time to take sides because no one's paying attention. Bring Tupperware.</p>
        <p>Dad: What is the difference between a piano, a tuna, and a pot of glue?
 Me: I don't know.
 Dad: You can tuna piano but you can't piano a tuna.
 Me: What about the pot of glue?
 Dad: I knew you'd get stuck on that.</p>
    <H3> HELLO</H3>
